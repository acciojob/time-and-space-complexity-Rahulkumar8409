  <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
  
  <p><b>Time complexity</b> is a fundamental concept in computer science that measures the efficiency of an algorithm. It quantifies the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete its task as a function of the input size. An efficient algorithm is one that can handle larger inputs without significantly increasing the time it takes to execute. Understanding time complexity helps in selecting the right algorithm for specific tasks and optimizing code for faster performance.</p>
  
  <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory space an algorithm requires to solve a problem. It evaluates how the memory usage grows relative to the input size. The notation <b>O(n)</b> is commonly used to denote linear space complexity, where the memory usage scales linearly with the input size <b>n</b>. Managing space complexity is crucial for creating scalable applications and preventing memory-related issues.</p>
