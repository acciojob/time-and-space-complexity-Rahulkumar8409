	  <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
  
  <p>Time complexity is a crucial concept in computer science that measures the efficiency of an algorithm concerning the amount of time it takes to run as a function of the input size. In other words, it determines how the execution time of an algorithm increases with larger inputs. An algorithm is considered efficient if its time complexity remains manageable even with larger datasets.</p>
  
  <p>On the other hand, <b>Space Complexity</b> deals with the amount of memory space an algorithm uses while executing. It's also a vital consideration, especially in resource-constrained environments. Space complexity is typically expressed in terms of <b>O(n)</b>, where <b>n</b> represents the input size. This notation signifies that the memory usage increases linearly with the input size. Optimizing space complexity is essential for creating memory-efficient algorithms that can handle large datasets without running out of memory.</p>
